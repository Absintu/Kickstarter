# Kickstarter

Kickstarter campaign adaptation from Udemy course\
This is an Ethereum project that resolves the known Kickstarter website issues.\
The manager of the campaign starts a new Campaign and assings a minimum contribution. After that
anyone with a wallet can contribute to this campaign.

The manager of certain campaign can also make requests with a description, value and recipient.
Then the "Approvers" (people that donated) vote for all the requests pending. If a certain request
has more than 50% of vote, the "Manager" can finalize and the recipient gets those Ethi Ethi.
